# Kubernetes With Docker Container

- we will start the `docker and kubernetes in a primer way`

- we will discuss the `containerization revolution that got started by Docker` and `How this will be evolved with Kubernetes container orchestration `

- we will go to the `introduction to container` where we will `unravel` the `history and key component` for the `containerization technology`

- we will then `look into the container images` and ` image layer and registry and tags`

- we will be looking into the `container , network , services and volumes `

- we will be looking into the `nginx in conjuction with container networking ,services and volumes` 


-  we have the `free part for the building the container images`  where we will be looking into 
   
   - `bilding docker images`
   
   - `pushing images to the container registry`
   
   - `making them available as the Multiplatform from the offset`


- **Kubernetes**

- we will then look into the `Kubernetes container runtime`


- here we will learn the `containerd` as the `kubernetes container runtime` and make use of the `component` called as `nerdctl` for the `docker like experience` which will assist in `learning kubernetes`


- we will learn `how to install kubernetes on the kubernetes installation section` , where we will install the `kubernetes with kubeadm` and also we will be making the use of a `CNI` which stands for the `container network interface`


- then we will learn about `kubernetes PODS` which is the `smallest unit of compute in  kubernetes`


- then we will see `How to Use` and `How to Manage` `kubernetes pod` using `kubectl`  


- then we will be looking at the `paused container` , which is a `significant component` which is `often missed`


- we will cover the `importance of pod container in kubernetes`


-  then we will look into the `kubernetes pod networking`


- we will see what happend to the `IP address` by using the `crash simulation of kubernetes pod` , where we will `intentionally crash the PODS` and `see the   effect on the IP address because of that` 


- we have the `Kubernetes YAML` where we will see `How to use YAML and extracted using the kubectl tool `

- we will also learn the `difference between apply and create` when working with `Kubernetes YAML`



- then we will look into the `kubernetes deployment` and see how these `deployments are used with replica set` for `high availablity`


- then we will be looking at the `kubernetes services`
  
  - we will explore the `different type of kubenetes service type` `that are availble` 
  
  - then we can look into the `real life use cases with cluster IP`
  

-  kubernetes `provided with` the `Awsome DNS Service` 
  
  - we will look into the `Kubernetes DNS Service` and check `How this bring app stability`


- then we will be looking into the `Kubernetes architecuter` and `which can give the through understanding how kubernetes works` 


- we will learn the `role of each component of kubernetes` , this will help in `trouble shooting the kubernetes cluster` if the `kubernetes lcuster not working as expected`


- we will `dismantle` the `entire kubernetes cluster` in a `safe and efficient manner`


- then we will be looking into `each kubernetes component` and `reinstating back to the cluster`


- this will provide the `overview` of `effect of each component have on the cluster` on `allowing the workload to run effectively `
